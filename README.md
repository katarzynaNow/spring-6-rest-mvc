# spring-6-rest-mvc
This repository is for an example application built in my Spring Framework 6 - Beginner to Guru online course.

The application is a simple Spring Boot 3 / Spring Framework 6 web application. It is used to learn Project Lombok and what it can bring to our application development and how it can help make us more productive.
